== Description

This plugin is a collection of methods to aid with common tag tasks and with
the console user in mind. These methods assume a common tagging schema.

   create_table :tags do |t|
      t.string :name
    end
    
    create_table :taggings do |t|
      t.integer :tag_id
      t.integer :taggable_id
      t.string :taggable_type
    end

== Caveats

Since there are no tests and some methods require external gems, your mileage may vary.
