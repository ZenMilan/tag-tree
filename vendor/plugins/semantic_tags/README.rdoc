== Description

This plugin isn't currently used but will probably be picked up in the future.
Although there may be some novel ideas here, it's probably not of much use until
further refactored.

== Setup

Install gems 'mbleigh-acts-as-taggable-on' and 'collectiveidea-awesome_nested_set'
and in your config add:

   config.gem "mbleigh-acts-as-taggable-on", :source => "http://gems.github.com", :lib =>"acts-as-taggable-on"
   config.gem "collectiveidea-awesome_nested_set", :source=>"http://gems.github.com", :lib=>"awesome_nested_set"
